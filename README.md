# Overview
For this project, we will be using multiple linear regression modeling to analyze the features used in determing house sales and prices in King's County, WA.

# Business Problem
Our team has been contracted by a real-estate company to help them improve the service they offer their customers. Specifically, we will be identifying features that impact house prices in Washington County. 

# Data
We used the King's County Housing Data to pull all the relevant features for determining the given price of the houses in that area. We also used an updated housing data that includes school district zones, mean household income, proximity to highest traffic,  proximity to hazardous water storage, and proximity to hazardous waste.
