# Overview
For this project, we will be using multiple linear regression modeling to analyze the features used in determing house sales and prices in King's County, WA.

# Business Problem

Our team has been contracted by a real-estate company to help them improve the service they offer their customers. Specifically, we will be identifying features that impact house prices in King's County, WA. 

# Data
We used the King's County Housing Data to pull all the relevant features for determining the given price of the houses in that area. We also used an updated housing data that includes school district zones, mean household income, proximity to highest traffic,  proximity to hazardous water storage, and proximity to hazardous waste.

# Features

The main features we will be looking at are:
- Model 1: all features (including School District, Year Renovated, Zip Code)
- Model 2: all features (except zip code and year renovated)
- Model 3: all features (except year renovated categoricals)

# Results
The predicted sale price of a house and the actual sale price of the house given the above features has a correlation of about .8069, or 80.69%.

The plot shows the features ranked by their estimated impact on the house price. The Y-axis represents the percentage in mean.
